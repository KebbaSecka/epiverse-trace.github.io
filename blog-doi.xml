  <title>Choosing the Right Parent for R Object Classes</title>
  <dc:creator>Hugo Gruson</dc:creator>
  <link>https://epiverse-trace.github.io/posts/parent-class/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><a href="https://hugogruson.fr/posts/compa-tibble/">I have recently published</a> a <a href="https://epiverse-trace.github.io/posts/s3-generic/">series of blog posts</a> on the reasons why one may want to start using object-oriented programming (and more specifically R S3 classes) to improve interoperability with other tools from the ecosystem.</p>
<p>But there are still questions I have not addressed directly, even if they may have been implicitly included sometimes: what makes a good object class? What good practices in class &amp; function design can improve interoperability?</p>
<p>As you can expect from these questions, this post will present a subjective view on S3 class and method design. I will argue that it is often a good strategy to inherit from existing standards classes, and to leverage this inheritance relationship as much as possible.</p>
<section id="inherit-from-standard-classes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="inherit-from-standard-classes">Inherit from standard classes</h2>
<p>A unique feature of R is the availability and centrality of <code>data.frame</code>s in the base language, whereas you need extra libraries for a similar functionality in most other languages (e.g., <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a> in Python).</p>
<p><code>data.frame</code> is one of the first “complex” (in the sense of <a href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz/vectors-chap.html#atomic-vectors">non-atomic</a>) object most R learners will be exposed to and will develop a familiarity with. A good way to leverage this familiarity is to <a href="https://epiverse-trace.github.io/posts/extend-dataframes/">make your subclass a thin wrapper around <code>data.frame</code>s</a>.</p>
<p>This means that not only will users be able to get started with your package faster because of this familiarity, but you will also immediately benefit from the huge ecosystem of functions and packages working on <code>data.frame</code>s, such as the <a href="https://tidyverse.org">tidyverse</a>. If you want some examples, this is what collaborators and I did in the <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/linelist">linelist</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rmaia/pavo">pavo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/epiforecasts/scoringutils">scoringutils</a>, <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epichains">epichains</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/vaccineff">vaccineff</a> R packages.</p>
<p>In some cases, the output is too complex to fit into a <code>data.frame</code>. Even in this situation, I would recommend inheriting from existing, well-established, classes for the same two reasons: familiarity and ecosystem. For example, for the <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/serofoi">serofoi</a> R package, <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/serofoi/pull/117">we have made the decision to inherit from <code>stanfit</code> objects, rather than a custom structure</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="rely-on-parent-methods-as-much-as-possible" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rely-on-parent-methods-as-much-as-possible">Rely on parent methods as much as possible</h2>
<p>A follow up recommendation from inheriting from standard classes is to leverage their methods wherever possible.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/linelist/pull/60">One of the first</a> <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/linelist/pull/61">changes I made</a> when becoming maintainer of the <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/linelist">linelist</a> package was to remove the <code>rename.linelist()</code> and <code>select.linelist()</code> methods. Indeed, they were, or could easily be, behaving identically as the parent <code>rename.data.frame()</code> and <code>select.data.frame()</code> methods. Rather than burdening the codebase and maintenance with an extra unnecessary method, it is much simpler and more robust to rely on the well-tested parent method. In fact, the <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/dplyr_extending.html">dplyr documentation</a> explicitly recommends only writing methods for a couple of standard functions (including <code>[.subclass()</code> and <code>names&lt;-.subclass()</code>), which will enable the use of parent methods directly, rather than writing custom methods for each dplyr function.</p>
<p>Similarly, many developers have the reflex to write a custom <code>print.subclass()</code> method as part of the method implementation. While it may be justified in some cases, it is sometimes unnecessary. My recommendation would be to evaluate carefully what benefits the custom method brings over the default parent method.</p>
</section>
<section id="enable-conversion-to-standard-classes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="enable-conversion-to-standard-classes">Enable conversion to standard classes</h2>
<p>If after careful consideration, extra metadata makes it too difficult to fit your new class into an existing class, you may sometimes have to define your own class from “scratch” (i.e., often <code>list()</code> in R).</p>
<p>But even in this case, you can still apply some of the ideas proposed earlier. As much as possible, you should provide helpers or methods to enable the streamlined conversion of your method to a standard class.</p>
<p>A good example here is the <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epiparameter">epiparameter</a> package, which provides a complex S3 class built on lists, including extensive metadata about probability distribution of epidemiological parameters. As such, this custom class cannot be used out of the box in most functions from other packages. <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epiparameter/blob/0f805b90f984def4851a78148f1cf44c3d480845/R/coercion.R#L18-L41">But an <code>as.function()</code> method is conveniently provided to enable the conversion of this probability distribution parameters into a density distribution</a>, which can then be used in functions which expect a <code>function</code> object.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, I recommend relying on well-established parent classes such as <code>data.frame</code>s or at least providing direct conversion functions to these standard classes, and using parent methods wherever possible rather than writing custom dedicated methods. This should help produce a package:</p>
<ul>
<li>more easily accessible for users because it uses objects that feel familiar</li>
<li>more maintainable because a lot of method writing is offloaded to the parent class</li>
<li>more likely to be interoperable because standard classes are a good way to pass data between functions or packages</li>
</ul>

  <title>Things that can go wrong when using renv</title>
  <dc:creator>Hugo Gruson</dc:creator>
  <link>https://epiverse-trace.github.io/posts/renv-complications/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Throughout the Epiverse project, we use the <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/renv/">renv R package</a> to ensure reproducibility of the training materials and the pipelines we are providing. But we sometimes get reports from users who struggle to rebuild the environment and run the code.</p>
<p>In this post, we dissect the source of these issues, explain why in reality renv is not at fault, and how this is caused by the inherent complexity of reproducibility. The renv documentation already includes <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html#caveats">caveats</a> explaining why some situations are bound to require more complex tools. This blog post reiterates some of these caveats and illustrates them with concrete examples.</p>
<p>Finally, we mention a couple of more complete (but more complex!) frameworks that can overcome the issues presented here. We do not explore these alternative framework in detail but provide links to more information.</p>
<section id="binaries-vs-building-from-source" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="binaries-vs-building-from-source">Binaries vs building from source</h2>
<p>Software, including R packages, can generally be delivered in two forms: as binaries or as source code. If you are building from the source code, you may in some case need a compilation toolchain on your computer. If that toolchain is missing, it can lead to errors such as:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode txt code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb1-1">ld: warning: search path '/opt/gfortran/lib' not found</span>
<span id="cb1-2">ld: library 'gfortran' not found</span></code></pre></div>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of the time, regular users of R will not see these errors because they are installing binaries. Indeed, CRAN provides pre-compiled binaries for Windows and macOS for the last version of the package and R.</p>
<p>With renv, you often want to install older versions of the packages, which won’t be available as binaries from CRAN. This means you are more likely to have to compile the package yourself and see this kind of errors, even though renv is not causing them.</p>

<section id="beyond-renv-scope-incompatibility-with-system-dependency-versions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="beyond-renv-scope-incompatibility-with-system-dependency-versions">Beyond renv scope: incompatibility with system dependency versions</h2>
<p>We <a href="../system-dependencies/">discussed previously the topic of system dependencies</a>, and <a href="https://blog.r-hub.io/2022/09/12/r-dependency/">dependencies on specific R versions</a>. These special dependencies can also be a source of headaches when using renv.</p>
<p>The heart of the issue is that renv provides a simplified solution to reproducibility: it focuses on R packages and their versions. But other sources of non-reproducibility are outside its scope. In many cases, this will not be a problem, as the main source of non-reproducibility, especially in the relatively short-term, will be R package versions.</p>
<p>But sometimes, it is possible that the <code>renv.lock</code> lockfile requires such an old version of an R package that it was written with a syntax that is no longer supported by recent R versions or modern compilers.</p>
<p>For example, a recent project (from 2023) was trying to install the version 0.60.1 of the <code>matrixStats</code> package (from 2021). This lead to this compilation error:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>error: ‘DOUBLE_XMAX’ undeclared (first use in this function); did you mean ‘DBL_MAX’?</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="alternative-package-managers">Alternative package managers</h3>
<p>We discussed how many issues when using renv can arise during the package compilation from source. A potential solution would be to avoid this compilation step and always install pre-compiled binaries.</p>
<p>This is not possible while installing from CRAN as CRAN only provides binaries for recent versions of R and for a limited number of platforms.</p>
<p>But Posit for example provides a larger collection of binaries, for different package versions, and different platforms, via their Public <a href="https://packagemanager.posit.co/">Posit Package Manager (PPM)</a>.</p>
<p>Making sure you install from PPM rather than CRAN can be a first simple step to make some of the issues discussed here vanish.</p>

<section id="renv-with-rig" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="renv-with-rig">renv with rig</h4>
<p>The R version is specified in <code>renv.lock</code> and to avoid incompatibility of older package versions with newer versions of R, you could run the declared R version. This can be achieved with various means but a convenient solution is the <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/rig">rig</a> tool.</p>
<p>There are even some <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/rig/issues/131">discussions</a> to integrate rig and renv more tightly and let rig detect automatically which R version to use based on the <code>renv.lock</code> file.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could use other reproducibility toolkits that focus not just on the R package versions, but on the entire software stack (e.g., including the operating system, the system dependencies).

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion-a-final-note-for-developers">Conclusion: a final note for developers</h3>
<p>renv is an elegant solution that focuses on the most immediate source of non-reproducibility. This however means it needs to be complemented by other tools in more complex cases.</p>
<p>Ultimately, reproducibility is a team effort. People who write code can minimise the risk of renv complications by keeping the packages they use close to their CRAN version and regularly updating their code and <code>renv.lock</code> accordingly. Other programming languages have automated tooling to help with this, via, e.g., the <a href="https://github.blog/2020-06-01-keep-all-your-packages-up-to-date-with-dependabot/">dependabot tool</a> which submits pull requests to update dependencies. There is no well established equivalent for R yet, but anyone willing to set this mechanism up can look at the code used by the <a href="https://github.com/carpentries/actions/tree/70ff4b4e8d50fdcd0eb33e7c33a4a6f305a82702/update-lockfile">Carpentries workbench</a> for this task.</p>
