    "title": "Ensuring & Showcasing the Statistical Correctness of your R Package",
    "section": "",
    "text": "We’re evolving in an increasingly data-driven world. And since critical decisions are taken based on results produced by data scientists and data analysts, they need to be be able to trust the tools they use. It is now increasingly common to add continuous integration to software packages and libraries, to ensure the code is not crashing, and that future updates don’t change your code output (snapshot tests). But one type of test still remains uncommon: tests for statistical correctness. That is, tests that ensure the algorithm implemented in your package actually produce the correct results.\n\nIt is likely that most statistical package authors run some tests on their own during development but there doesn’t seem to be guidelines on how to test statistical correctness in a solid and standard way 1.\nIn this blog post, we explore various methods to ensure the statistical correctness of your software. We argue that these tests should be part of your continuous integration system, to ensure your tools remains valid throughout its life, and to let users verify how you validate your package. Finally, we show how these principles are implemented in the Epiverse TRACE tools.\nThe approaches presented here are non-exclusive and should ideally all be added to your tests. However, they are presented in order of stringency and priority to implement. We also take a example of a function computing the centroid of a list of points to demonstrate how you would integrate the recommendations from this post with the {testthat} R package, often used from unit testing:\n\n#' Compute the centroid of a set of points\n#'\n#' @param coords Coordinates of the points as a list of vectors. Each element of the \n#'   list is a point.\n#'\n#' @returns A vector of coordinates of the same length of each element of \n#'   `coords`\n#'   \n#' @examples\n#' centroid(list(c(0, 1, 5, 3), c(8, 6, 4, 3), c(10, 2, 3, 7)))\n#' \ncentroid &lt;- function(coords) {\n\n  # ...\n  # Skip all the necessary input checking for the purpose of this demo\n  # ...\n\n  coords_mat &lt;- do.call(rbind, coords)\n  \n  return(colMeans(coords_mat))\n  \n}\n\n\nCompare your results to the reference implementation\nThe most straightforward and most solid way to ensure your implementation is valid is to compare your results to the results of the reference implementation. The reference implementation can be a package in another language, an example with toy data in the scientific article introducing the method, etc.\nFor example, the {gemma2} R package, which re-implements the methods from the GEMMA tool written in C++, verifies that values produced by both tools match:\ntest_that(\"Results of gemma2 equal those of GEMMA v 0.97\", {\n  expect_equal(Sigma_ee, diag(c(18.559, 12.3672)), tolerance = 0.0001)\n  expect_equal(Sigma_uu, diag(c(82.2973, 41.9238)), tolerance = 0.0001)\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample with centroid()\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(testthat)\n\ntest_that(\"centroid() in 1D produces the same results as mean()\", {\n\n  x &lt;- list(1, 5, 3, 10, 5)\n\n  expect_identical(centroid(x), mean(unlist(x)))\n  \n})\n\nTest passed 😀\n\n\n\n\nNote that even if a reference implementation doesn’t exist, it is still good practice to compare your implementation to competing ones. Discrepancies might reveal a bug in your implementation or theirs but in any case, finding it out is beneficial to the community.\nHowever, this approach cannot be used in all cases. Indeed, there may not be a reference implementation in your case. Or it might be difficult to replicate identical computations in the case of algorithm with stochasticity 2.\n\n\nCompare to a theoretical upper or lower bound\nAn alternative strategy is to compare your result to theoretical upper or lower bound. This offers a weaker guarantee that your implementation and your results are correct but it can still allow you to detect important mistakes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample with centroid()\n\n\n\n\ntest_that(\"centroid() is inside the hypercube containing the data points\", {\n  \n  x &lt;- list(c(0, 1, 5, 3), c(8, 6, 4, 3), c(10, 2, 3, 7))\n\n  expect_true(all(centroid(x) &lt;= Reduce(pmax, x)))\n  expect_true(all(centroid(x) &gt;= Reduce(pmin, x)))\n  \n})\n\nTest passed 😀\n\n\n\n\nYou can see a real-life example of this kind of test in the {finalsize} R package. {finalsize} computes the final proportion of infected in a heterogeneous population according to an SIR model. Theory predicts that the number of infections is maximal in a well-mixed population:\n# Calculates the upper limit of final size given the r0\n# The upper limit is given by a well mixed population\nupper_limit &lt;- function(r0) {\n  f &lt;- function(par) {\n    abs(1 - exp(-r0 * par[1]) - par[1])\n  }\n  opt &lt;- optim(\n    par = 0.5, fn = f,\n    lower = 0, upper = 1,\n    method = \"Brent\"\n  )\n  opt\n}\n\n\nVerify that output is changing as expected when a single parameter varies\nAn even looser way to test statistical correctness would be to control that output varies as expected when you update some parameters. This could be for example, checking that the values you return increase when you increase or decrease one of your input parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample with centroid()\n\n\n\n\ntest_that(\"centroid() increases when coordinates from one point increase\", {\n  \n  x &lt;- list(c(0, 1, 5, 3), c(8, 6, 4, 3), c(10, 2, 3, 7))\n  \n  y &lt;- x\n  y[[1]] &lt;- y[[1]] + 1 \n\n  expect_true(all(centroid(x) &lt; centroid(y)))\n  \n})\n\nTest passed 🌈\n\n\n\n\nAn example of this test in an actual R package can again be found in the finalsize package:\nr0_low &lt;- 1.3\nr0_high &lt;- 3.3\n\nepi_outcome_low &lt;- final_size(\n  r0 = r0_low,\n  &lt;...&gt;\n)\nepi_outcome_high &lt;- final_size(\n  r0 = r0_high,\n  &lt;...&gt;\n)\n\ntest_that(\"Higher values of R0 result in a higher number of infectious in all groups\", {\n  expect_true(\n    all(epi_outcome_high$p_infected &gt; epi_outcome_low$p_infected)\n  )\n})\n\n\nConclusion: automated validation vs peer-review\nIn this post, we’ve presented different methods to automatically verify the statistical correctness of your statistical software. We would like to highlight one more time that it’s important to run these tests are part of your regular integration system, instead of running them just once at the start of the development. This will prevent the addition of possible errors in the code and show users what specific checks you are doing. By doing so, you are transparently committing to the highest quality.\nMultiple voices in the community are pushing more towards peer-review as a proxy for quality and validity:\n\nWe would like to highlight that automated validation and peer review are not mutually exclusive and answer slightly different purposes.\nOn the one hand, automated validation fails to catch more obscure bugs and edge cases. For example, a bug that would be difficult to detect via automated approach is the use of bad Random Number Generators when running in parallel.\nBut on the other hand, peer-review is less scalable, and journals usually have some editorial policy that might not make your package a good fit. Additionally, peer-review usually happens at one point in time while automated validation can, and should, be part of the continuous integration system.\nIdeally, peer-review and automated validation should work hand-in-hand, with review informing the addition of new automated valiation tests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut see the “testing statistical software” post from Alex Hayes where he presents his process to determine if he deems a statistical package trustworthy or not, and rOpenSci Statistical Software Peer Review book.↩︎\nSetting the random seed is not enough to compare implementations across programming languages because different languages use different kind of Random Number Generators.↩︎\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{gruson2023,\n  author = {Gruson, Hugo},\n  title = {Ensuring \\& {Showcasing} the {Statistical} {Correctness} of\n    Your {R} {Package}},\n  date = {2023-02-13},\n  url = {https://epiverse-trace.github.io//posts/statistical-correctness},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nGruson, Hugo. 2023. “Ensuring & Showcasing the Statistical\nCorrectness of Your R Package.” February 13, 2023. https://epiverse-trace.github.io//posts/statistical-correctness."

The data frame (class data.frame) is a flexible tabular data structure, as it can hold different data types (e.g. numbers, character strings, etc.) across different columns. This is in contrast to matrices – which are arrays with dimensions – and thus can only hold a single data type.\n\n# data frame can hold heterogeneous data types across different columns\ndata.frame(a = c(1, 2, 3), b = c(4, 5, 6), c = c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"))\n\n  a b c\n1 1 4 a\n2 2 5 b\n3 3 6 c\n\n# each column must be of the same type\ndf &lt;- data.frame(a = c(1, 2, 3), b = c(\"4\", 5, 6))\n# be careful of the silent type conversion\ndf$a\n\n[1] 1 2 3\n\ndf$b\n\n[1] \"4\" \"5\" \"6\"\n\nmat &lt;- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)\nmat\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    1    4    7\n[2,]    2    5    8\n[3,]    3    6    9\n\nmat[1, 1] &lt;- \"1\"\n# be careful of the silent type conversion\nmat\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,] \"1\"  \"4\"  \"7\" \n[2,] \"2\"  \"5\"  \"8\" \n[3,] \"3\"  \"6\"  \"9\" \n\n\nData frames can even be nested, cells can be data frames or lists.\n\ndf &lt;- data.frame(a = \"w\", b = \"x\")\ndf[1, 1][[1]] &lt;- list(c = c(\"y\", \"z\"))\ndf\n\n     a b\n1 y, z x\n\ndf &lt;- data.frame(a = \"w\", b = \"x\")\ndf[1, 1][[1]] &lt;- list(data.frame(c = \"y\", d = \"z\"))\ndf\n\n     a b\n1 y, z x\n\n\nIt is therefore clear why data frames are so prevalent. However, they are not without limitations. They have a relatively basic printing method which can fload the R console when the number of columns or rows is large. They have useful methods (e.g., summary() and str()), but these might not be appropriate for certain types of tabular data. In these cases it is useful to utilise R’s inheritance mechanisms (specifically S3 inheritance) to write extensions for R’s data.frame class. In this case the data frame is the superclass and the new subclass extends it and inherits its methods (see the Advanced R book for more details on S3 inheritance).\nOne of the most common extension of the data frame is the tibble from the {tibble} R package. Outlined in {tibble}’s vignette, tibbles offer improvements in printing, subsetting and recycling rules. Another commonly used data frame extension is the data.table class from the {data.table} R package. In addition to the improved printing, this class is designed to improve the performance (i.e. speed and efficiency of operations and storage) of working with tabular data in R and provide a terse syntax for manipulation.\nIn the process of developing R software (most likely an R package), a new tabular data class that builds atop data frames can become beneficial. This blog post has two main sections:\n\na brief overview of the steps required to setup a class that extends data frames\nguide to the technical aspects of class invariants (required data members of a class) and design and implementation decisions, and tidyverse compatibility\n\n\n\nIt is useful to write a class constructor function that can be called to create an object of your new class. The functions defined below are a redacted version (for readability) of functions available in the {ExtendDataFrames} R package, which contains example functions and files discussed in this post. When assigning the class name ensure that it is a vector containing \"data.frame\" as the last element to correctly inherit properties and methods from the data.frame class.\nbirthdays &lt;- function(x) {\n  # the vector of classes is required for it to inherit from `data.frame`\n  structure(x, class = c(\"birthdays\", \"data.frame\"))\n}\nThat’s all that’s needed to create a subclass of a data frame. However, although we’ve created the class we haven’t given it any functionality and thus it will be identical to a data frame due to inheritance.\nWe can now write as many methods as we want. Here we will show two methods, one of which does not require writing a generic (print.birthdays) and the second that does (birthdays_per_month). The print() generic function is provided by R, which is why we do not need to add one ourselves. See Adv R and this Epiverse blog post to find out more about S3 generics.\nprint.birthdays &lt;- function(x, ...) {\n  cat(\n    sprintf(\n      \"A `birthdays` object with %s rows and %s cols\",\n      dim(x)[1], dim(x)[2]\n    )\n  )\n  invisible(x)\n}\n\nbirthdays_per_month &lt;- function(x, ...) {\n  UseMethod(\"birthdays_per_month\")\n}\n\nbirthdays_per_month.birthdays &lt;- function(x, ...) {\n  out &lt;- table(lubridate::month(x$birthday))\n  months &lt;- c(\n    \"Jan\", \"Feb\", \"Mar\", \"Apr\", \"May\", \"Jun\",\n    \"Jul\", \"Aug\", \"Sep\", \"Oct\", \"Nov\", \"Dec\"\n  )\n  names(out) &lt;- months[as.numeric(names(out))]\n  return(out)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nUseful resources for the “Writing custom data class” section: extending tibbles and their functionality\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will now move on to the second section of the post, in which we discuss the design choices when creating and using S3 classes in R. Class invariants are members of your class that define it. In other words, without these elements your class does not fulfil its basic definition. It is therefore sensible to make sure that your class contains these elements at all times (or at least after operations have been applied to your class). In cases when the class object contains all the invariants normal service can be continued. However, in the case that an invariant is missing or modified to a non-conformist type (e.g. a date converted to a numeric) a decision has to be made. Either the code can error, hopefully giving the user an informative message as to why their modification broke the object; alternatively, the subclass can be revoked and the superclass can be returned. In almost all cases the superclass (i.e. the base class being inherited from) is more general and won’t have the same class invariant restrictions.\nFor our example class, &lt;birthdays&gt;, the invariants are a column called name which must contain characters, and a column called birthday which must contain dates. The order of the rows and columns is not considered an invariant property, and having extra columns with other names and data types is also allowed. The number of rows is also not an invariant as we can have as many birthdays as we like in the data object.\nHere we present both cases as well as considerations and technical details of both options. We’ll demonstrate both of these cases with the subset function in R (subsetting uses a single square bracket for tabular data, [). First the fail-on-subsetting. Before we write the subsetting function it is useful to have a function that checks that an object of our class is valid, a so-called validator function.\n\nvalidate_birthdays &lt;- function(x) {\n  stopifnot(\n    \"input must contain 'name' and 'birthday' columns\" =\n      all(c(\"name\", \"birthday\") %in% colnames(x)),\n    \"names must be a character\" =\n      is.character(x$name),\n    \"birthday must be a date\" =\n      lubridate::is.Date(x$birthday)\n  )\n  invisible(x)\n}\n\nThis will return an error if the class is not valid (defined in terms of the class’ invariants).\nNow we can show how to error if one of the invariants are removed during subsetting. See ?NextMethod() for information on method dispatch.\n\n`[.birthdays` &lt;- function(x) {\n  validate_birthdays(NextMethod())\n}\n\nbirthdays[, -1]\n#  Error in validate_birthdays(NextMethod()) :\n#  input must contain 'name' and 'birthday' columns\n\nThe second design option is the reconstruct-on-subsetting. This checks whether the class is valid, and if not downgrade the class to the superclass, in our case a data frame. This is done by not only validating the object during subsetting but to check whether it is a valid class object, and then either ensuring all of the attributes of the subclass – in our case &lt;birthdays&gt; – are maintained, or attributes are stripped and only the attributes of the base superclass – in our case data.frame – are kept.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nImportant note: this section of the post relies heavily on https://github.com/DavisVaughan/2020-06-01_dplyr-vctrs-compat.\n\n\nThe four functions that are required to be added to ensure our class is correctly handled when invaliding it are:\n\nbirthdays_reconstruct()\nbirthdays_can_reconstruct()\ndf_reconstruct()\ndplyr_reconstruct.birthdays()\n\nWe’ll tackle the first three first, and then move onto to the last one as this requires some extra steps.\nbirthdays_reconstruct() is a function that contains an if-else statement to determine whether the returned object is a &lt;birthdays&gt; or data.frame object.\n\nbirthdays_reconstruct &lt;- function(x, to) {\n  if (birthdays_can_reconstruct(x)) {\n    df_reconstruct(x, to)\n  } else {\n     x &lt;- as.data.frame(x)\n    message(\"Removing crucial column in `&lt;birthdays&gt;` returning `&lt;data.frame&gt;`\")\n    x\n  }\n}\n\nThe if-else evaluation is controlled by birthdays_can_reconstruct(). This function determines whether after subsetting the object is a valid &lt;birthdays&gt; class. It checks whether the validator fails, in which case it returns FALSE, otherwise the function will return TRUE.\n\nbirthdays_can_reconstruct &lt;- function(x) {\n  # check whether input is valid\n  valid &lt;- tryCatch(\n    { validate_birthdays(x) },\n    error = function(cnd) FALSE\n  )\n\n  # return boolean\n  !isFALSE(valid)\n}\n\nThe next function required is df_reconstruct(). This is called when the object is judged to be a valid &lt;birthdays&gt; object and simply copies the attributes over from the &lt;birthdays&gt; class to the object being subset.\n\ndf_reconstruct &lt;- function(x, to) {\n  attrs &lt;- attributes(to)\n  attrs$names &lt;- names(x)\n  attrs$row.names &lt;- .row_names_info(x, type = 0L)\n  attributes(x) &lt;- attrs\n  x\n}\n\nThe three functions defined for reconstruction can be added to a package with the subsetting function in order to subset &lt;birthdays&gt; objects and returning either &lt;birthdays&gt; objects if still valid, or data frames when invalidated. This design has the benefit that when conducting data exploration a user is not faced with an error, but can continue with a data frame, while being informed by the message printed to console in birthdays_reconstruct().\n\n`[.birthdays` &lt;- function(x, ...) {\n  out &lt;- NextMethod()\n  birthdays_reconstruct(out, x)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nIn order to be able to operate on our &lt;birthdays&gt; class using functions from the package {dplyr}, as would be common for data frames, we need to make our function compatible. This is where the function dplyr_reconstruct.birthdays() comes in. dplyr_reconstruct() is a generic function exported by {dplyr}. It is called in {dplyr} verbs to make sure that the objects are restored to the input class when not invalidated.\n\ndplyr_reconstruct.birthdays &lt;- function(data, template) { # nolint\n  birthdays_reconstruct(data, template)\n}\n\nInformation about the generic can be found through the {dplyr} help documentation.\n\n?dplyr::dplyr_extending\n?dplyr::dplyr_reconstruct\n\nAs explained in the help documentation, {dplyr} also uses two base R functions to perform data manipulation. names&lt;- (i.e the names setter function) and [ the one-dimensional subsetting function. We therefore define these methods for our custom class in order for dplyr_reconstruct() to work as intended.\n\n`[.birthdays` &lt;- function(x, ...) {\n  out &lt;- NextMethod()\n  birthdays_reconstruct(out, x)\n}\n\n`names&lt;-.birthdays` &lt;- function(x, value) {\n  out &lt;- NextMethod()\n  birthdays_reconstruct(out, x)\n}\n\nThis wraps up the need for adding function to perform data manipulation using the reconstruction design outlined above.\nHowever, there is some final housekeeping to do. In cases when {dplyr} is not a package dependency (either imported or suggested), then the S3 generic dplyr_reconstruct() is required to be loaded. In R versions before 3.6.0 – this also works for R versions later than 3.6.0 – the generic function needs to be registered. This is done by writing an .onLoad() function, typically in a file called zzz.R. This is included in the {ExtendDataFrames} package for illustrative purposes.\n\n\n\nzzz.R\n\n.onLoad &lt;- function(libname, pkgname) {\n  s3_register(\"dplyr::dplyr_reconstruct\", \"birthdays\")\n  invisible()\n}\n\n\nThe s3_register() function used in .onLoad() also needs to be added to the package and this function is kindly supplied by both {vctrs} and {rlang} unlicensed and thus can be copied into another package. See the R packages book for information about .onLoad() and attaching and loading in general.\nSince R version 3.6.0 this S3 generic registration happens automatically with S3Method() in the package namespace using the {roxygen2} documentation #' @exportS3Method dplyr::dplyr_reconstruct.\nThere is one last option which prevents the hard dependency on a relatively recent R version. Since {roxygen2} version 6.1.0, there is the @rawNamespace tag which allows insertion of text into the NAMESPACE file. Using this tag the following code will check the local R version and register the S3 method if equal to or above 3.6.0.\n\n#' @rawNamespace if (getRversion() &gt;= \"3.6.0\") {\n#'   S3method(pkg::fun, class)\n#' }\n\nEach of the three options for registering S3 methods has different benefits and downsides, so the choice depends on the specific use-case. Over time it may be best to use the most up-to-date methods as packages are usually only maintained for a handful of recent R releases1.\nThe topics discussed in this post have been implemented in the {epiparameter} R package within Epiverse-TRACE.\nCompatibility with {vctrs} is also possible using the same mechanism (functions) described in this post, and if interested see https://github.com/DavisVaughan/2020-06-01_dplyr-vctrs-compat for details.\nFor other use-cases and discussions of the designs and implementations discussed in this post see:\n\n{dials} R package\n{rsample} R package\n{googledrive} R package\nPull request on {tibble} R package\n\nThis blog post is a compendium of information from sources that are linked and cited throughout.

Using this tag the following code will check the local R version and register the S3 method if equal to or above 3.6.0.\n\n#' @rawNamespace if (getRversion() &gt;= \"3.6.0\") {\n#'   S3method(pkg::fun, class)\n#' }\n\nEach of the three options for registering S3 methods has different benefits and downsides, so the choice depends on the specific use-case. Over time it may be best to use the most up-to-date methods as packages are usually only maintained for a handful of recent R releases1.\nThe topics discussed in this post have been implemented in the {epiparameter} R package within Epiverse-TRACE.\nCompatibility with {vctrs} is also possible using the same mechanism (functions) described in this post, and if interested see https://github.com/DavisVaughan/2020-06-01_dplyr-vctrs-compat for details.\nFor other use-cases and discussions of the designs and implementations discussed in this post see:\n\n{dials} R package\n{rsample} R package\n{googledrive} R package\nPull request on {tibble} R package\n\nThis blog post is a compendium of information from sources that are linked and cited throughout.

    "text": "To build a tight and well-integrated data pipeline, it may be desirable to rely on object orientation (OO) to automatically pass valuable information from one step to the other. OO and data classes can also act as a compatibility layer standardising outputs from various tools under a common structure.\nBut many packages and software start as standalone projects, and don’t always stem from a careful consideration of the larger ecosystem. In this situation, developers often see little benefit of using an OO system in their project initially.\nBut as the project matures, and as the position of the tool in the wider ecosystem becomes clearer, they may want to start using OO to benefit from the better integration it may provide with other tools upstream and downstream in the data pipeline. However, by then, their tool likely has an established community of users, and it is important to tread carefully with breaking changes.\nIn this blog post, we show that it’s possible to start using an S3 OO system almost invisibly in your R package, with minimal disruption to your users. We detail some minor changes that will nonetheless occur, and which pitfalls you should be looking out for. Finally, we take a step back and reflect how you should ensure you are a good open-source citizen in this endeavour."

This is more idiomatic in R, and in line with the recommendation from the official ‘Writing R Extensions’ document (“always keep generics simple”):\n\n#' @export\ncentroid &lt;- function(coords, ...) { \n  UseMethod(\"centroid\") \n}\n\n#' @rdname centroid\n#' \n#' @export\ncentroid.default &lt;- function(coords, weights, ...) {\n\n  coords_mat &lt;- do.call(rbind, coords)\n  \n  return(apply(coords_mat, 2, weighted.mean, w = weights))\n  \n}\n\nBut this extra ... argument, which is documented as “ignored”, may be confusing as well."

For example, if you defined the original centroid() function in a package called geometryops, the S3 generic should also be defined in that package, not in the package defining the pointset class.\nIt is possible in theory to overwrite a function defined by another package with a generic (“overloading”). For example, we could overload base R table() function with:\n\ntable &lt;- function(...) { \n  UseMethod(...)\n}\n\ntable.default &lt;- function(\n  ...,\n  exclude = if (useNA == \"no\") c(NA, NaN),\n  useNA = c(\"no\", \"ifany\", \"always\"),\n  dnn = list.names(...), deparse.level = 1\n) {\n\n base::table(\n  ...,\n  exclude = exclude,\n  useNA = useNA,\n  dnn = dnn\n )\n\n}\n\nBut this is generally considered bad practice, and possibly rude 2.

    "text": "Where should the methods live?\nFor methods, there is more flexibility than for generics. They could either in the package defining the class, or in the package defining the generic. Let’s present the practical setup in both cases, as well as each strategy pros & cons.\n\nMethod in the class package\nThis is the strategy used when you defined a new class and provide it with a print(), a summary(), or a plot() method. The generics for these functions are defined in R base.\n\n#' @export\nplot.myclass &lt;- function(x, y, ...) {\n  \n  # code for a beautiful plot for your custom class\n  \n}\n\nIf you opt for this strategy, you will need to depend on the package providing the method, as Imports. For example, a package defining a fit.myclass() method for the fit() generic defined in the generics package would have the following DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nImports:\n  generics\n\n\n\nfit.myclass.R\n\n#' @export\n#' @importFrom generics fit\nfit.myclass &lt;- function(x, ...) {\n  # your code here\n}\n\n\n\nNAMESPACE\n\n# Generated by roxygen2: do not edit by hand\n\nS3method(fit,myclass)\nimportFrom(generics,fit)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImporting the generic\n\n\n\nIt’s worth insisting that you need to import the generic in your NAMESPACE for the method to be recognized and exported correctly by roxygen2. In this specific situation, simply explicitly prefixing the generic call (generic::fit()) is not enough.\n\n\nBut this can lead to a rapid increase in the number of dependencies if you provide methods for generics from various packages. Since R 3.6, you can also put generics in Suggests and use delayed assignment:\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nSuggests:\n  generics\n\n\n\nfit.myclass.R\n\n#' @exportS3Method generics::fit\nfit.myclass &lt;- function(x, ...) {\n  # your code here\n}\n\n\n\nNAMESPACE\n\n# Generated by roxygen2: do not edit by hand\n\nS3method(generics::fit,myclass)\n\n\n\nMethod in the generic package\nAlternatively, you can define the method in the package defining the generic. This is the approach taken in the report package from example, which defines the report() generic and methods for various model outputs produced by different package.\nIn theory, no Imports or Suggests is required here:\n\n#' @export\nmygeneric &lt;- function(x, ...) { \n  UseMethod(x)\n}\n\n#' @export\nmygeneric.externalclass &lt;- function(x, ...) {\n  # your code here\n}\n\nHowever, if you end up providing many methods for a specific class, you could put the package defining it in the uncommon Enhances field. Enhances is defined in ‘Writing R Extensions’ as:\n\nThe ‘Enhances’ field lists packages “enhanced” by the package at hand, e.g., by providing methods for classes from these packages.\n\nIt may be a good idea to explicitly signal the strong relationship between both packages so that the package defining the method is checked as a reverse dependency, and informed of potential breaking changes as discussed below. You may see an example of this in the slam package, which provides his methods for both base matrices and sparse matrices, as defined in the Matrix and the spam packages.\n\n\nCoordination between maintainers\nNo matter the strategy you end up choosing, we strongly recommend you keep an open communication channel between the class package and the generic package developer (provided they are not the same person) as breaking changes will impact both parties."

    "text": "Turning off linting and formatting\nThere are cases in which we might want to turn linting and formatting off. This might be when the linter does not agree with valid C++ code required in the project, or when the linters and stylers do not agree with each other. These tools are developed separately by large software projects with their own internal requirements, and solutions to issues encountered in their work: clang-format by LLVM (although specifying -style=google), and cpplint from Google’s work.\n\nLinter-enforced paradigms\nSometimes, the linter or styler developer enforces both a style and the use of certain programming paradigms. An example from cpplint is when it warns against passing function arguments by reference, and prefers for these to be passed as pointers, or as constant references (const int &value).\nint some_function(int &value) { \n  /* operations modifying value */\n  return value;\n}\nPassing the argument as a const reference would not serve the needs of this function, and passing by value is a valid strategy when we don’t want to get into the details of using pointers. (Note that this is typically an issue when large objects such as custom classes or structs are passed to a function multiple times.)\nSimilarly, cpplint will throw a warning about accessing variables using std::move, which is something we encounter in the Newton solver in {finalsize}. While not technically wrong for such a simple use case, the linter is correct to cautiously throw a warning nonetheless.\n\n\nLinter-styler disagreement\nOne example of linter-styler disagreement is the use of BOOST_FOREACH from the Boost libraries as an alternative to for loops. clang-format will insist on adding two spaces before the opening bracket: BOOST_FOREACH  (). cpplint will insist on removing one space.\ncpplint and clang-format also disagree on the order of header inclusions, especially when both local and system headers are included.\n\n\nDisabling checks on code chunks\nEither of these cases could require disabling linting or formatting on some part of the code. It is possible to turn off linting using cpplint at particular lines using the comment // NOLINT. Multiple lines can be protected from linting as well.\n// NOLINTBEGIN\n&lt;some C++ code here&gt;\n// NOLINTEND\nAlternatively, clang-format can be instructed to ignore chunks of code using comment messages too.\n// clang-format off\n&lt;some C++ code here&gt;\n// clang-format on"

But these tools remain difficult to use and to integrate in a data analysis pipeline. There is a need for a more integrated approach, ensuring that the various tools work well with one another. For example, minimal data wrangling should be needed to transform the output of one tool before passing it to the next tool down the data analysis pipeline. Similarly, various alternatives for a single step of the pipeline should as much as possible use the same inputs and return the same outputs. In this talk, I will present the Epiverse-TRACE project, which collaborates with many R package developers in epidemiology to integrate their tools in a unified universe. Indeed, the unique and challenging feature of Epiverse is that it doesn’t intend to create a unified universe from scratch, but instead aims at updating existing external pieces of software to better work together. This talk will explain how we identify the key parts that should be updated, and how we make these updates with minimal disruption to the individual package developers and established community of users."

    "text": "Questions from the audience\n\nHow do you incentivize developers to collaborate with you?\n\nAs mentioned in the presentation, we argue that collaboration results in a lower maintenance load for each developer by externalising and sharing the maintenance load of common elements.\nWe also think this is the logical continuation of releasing an open-source piece of software. If the goal is to provide a service to the community, then this service is surely greater if we collaborate to make the various pieces interoperable.\nAs an anecdotal piece of evidence, Nick Tierney, the maintainer of the conmat R package, has been very keen to participate in this project and was immediately convinced of the relevance and benefit for users and the ecosystem as a whole.\n\nHow do you ensure the long-term sustainability of this project?\n\nThis is an important question in the domain of open-source and research software but this is not the specific focus of this project and we don’t provide specific solutions, besides conforming to best practices.\nHowever, if anything, our projects should be more sustainable by construction since they result from a collaborative work and include multiple maintainers. This is also encoded in our projects by creating dedicated GitHub organisations, where all developers can participate on an equal footing, thereby also increasing the lottery factor."
