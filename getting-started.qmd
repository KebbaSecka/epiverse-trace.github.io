Our aim is to help change how analytics are used in the global infectious disease response, moving towards integrated, generalisable and scalable community-driven software.

## Quickstart

To install and load all the latest stable versions, as released on CRAN, install the **epiverse** meta-package as follows:

```r
pak::pak('epiverse-trace/epiverse')
library(epiverse)

# Loading required package: cfr
# Loading required package: cleanepi
# Loading required package: finalsize
# Loading required package: linelist
```

This will allow you to start using these packages in your analyses. You can then follow the quick starts for the respective packages:

* [cfr - quick start](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/cfr/#quick-start)
* [cleanepi - quick start](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/cleanepi/#quick-start)
* [finalsize](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/finalsize/#quick-start)
* [linelist](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/linelist/#usage)

## Roadmap

More packages are in development, but not yet with a stable release. our roadmap is to cover early through late tasks :

![ ](task_pipeline-minimal.svg){fig-alt='A typical epidemiological pipeline presented as a flowchart. Each box corresponds to a specific task (e.g., "reconstruct transmission chains", or "estimate severity"). The tasks are split into three categories based on the position in the data pipeline: early tasks, middle tasks and late tasks.'}

### Epiverse-TRACE packages

We are developing the following packages. These are built on methods and analysis that have informed epidemic response to infections including cholera, COVID, dengue, diphtheria, Ebola, influenza, and Zika.

[Early tasks]{.task}

[Middle tasks]{.task}

[Late tasks]{.task}

::: {.hex-container}

```{r, results='asis', echo = FALSE}
file.path("_data", "epiverse_pkgs.csv") |>
  read.csv() |>
  as.list() |>
  purrr::transpose() |>
  purrr::map_chr(~ knitr::knit_expand(file = "_templates/hexwall_element.Rmd",
                                      pkgname = .x$pkgname,
                                      description = .x$description)) |>
  cat(sep = "\n")
```

:::

Install development versions using the following command in R:

```r
pak::pak('epiverse-trace/<package-name>')
```

This will install the development version for you to try out. Please note that these may change until they have a stable release.
