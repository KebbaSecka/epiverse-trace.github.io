## Introduction

There is an ongoing outbreak of mpox globally that will require a coordinated response from the global health community. The Epiverse-TRACE team is developing a set of tools to help provide analytics support to decision-makers during this outbreak.

This post provides an overview of aspects of analytics that could support decision-making in the context of the ongoing outbreak of mpox. For each scenario, we briefly describe the data required to inform these decisions, and the ready tools developed by the Epiverse-TRACE team and the wider community.

## Decision-making scenarios

Outbreak analytics in the context of the ongoing mpox outbreak can be broadly classified into estimating the reproductive number, identifying transmission clusters, and assessing the impact of interventions.

### Reproductive number and superspreading

A key initial question during emerging outbreaks is the transmission potential of the disease. This is typically quantified using parameters such as: the basic reproduction number, $R0$; the time varying reproduction number, $Rt$; and $k$, which captures individual heterogeneity in transmission (i.e. 'superspreading' potential).

These quantities are useful to assess the potential for further spread of the disease and the impact of interventions.

Two types of reproduction numbers are commonly used to quantify the transmission potential of infectious diseases: the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, and the instanteneous reproduction number, $R_t$. The basic reproduction number is the average number of secondary cases produced by a single infected individual in a completely susceptible population. The instantaneous reproduction number is the average number of secondary cases produced by a single infected individual at time $t$ in a partially susceptible population. The instantaneous reproduction number is a more useful quantity during an outbreak as it accounts for the impact of interventions and changes in population immunity.

If data are available on the daily number of reported cases, [EpiNow2](https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow2/) and  [EpiEstim](https://mrc-ide.github.io/EpiEstim/) allow estimation of the time varying reproduction number, $Rt$. These packages require data on the timescale of transmission (i.e. the generation time, or the serial interval, which is [commonly used as a proxy](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2020.0756) for this).

To adjust for delays in symptom onset and reporting, `{EpiNow2}` also takes incubation period and reporting delay as inputs, although the latter can be estimated from the data using `{EpiNow2}` if data on incidence by date of onset and report are available. 

If individual-level data are available, packages such as {[epidist](https://epidist.epinowcast.org/articles/epidist.html)} offer the ability to estimate delay distributions, accounting for issues such as truncation (i.e. not all disease outcomes will be known yet in real-time).

Tools like {[cleanepi](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/cleanepi/)} can be used to clean these individual-level datasets, and {[listlist](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/linelist/)} can be used to tag and validate key variables in datasets that might change overtime. {[numberize](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/numberize/)} can also be used to convert numbers-as-characters if needed.

If such data are not avaiable, published estimates of the incubation period and serial interval can be obtained from the [epiparameter](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epiparameter/) package, which collates a database of epidemiological distributions from the literature and provides functions for interacting with the database. See the [database here](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epiparameter/dev/articles/database) for currently available parameters (more entries are planned).

Additionally, if only summary statistics in reports are available (e.g. range and median), we can use {epiparameter} to extract such values.

If we have data on the distribution of sizes of transmission clusters, the [epichains](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epichains/) package provides functions to estimate the basic reproduction number, $R0$, and the dispersion parameter $k$ of the negative binomial distribution, which is a measure of superspreading.

If we have individual-level transmission chain data, the [superspreading](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/superspreading/) package can be used to estimate $R_0$ and $k$ from the offspring distribution. This package as provides functions to estimate the probability that an outbreak will not go extinct in its early stages because of randomness in transmission (e.g. if the primary spillover case(s) does not infect others).

If have data on sexual contacts and the secondary attack rate, then we can also use {superspreading} to [calculate R accounting for network effects](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/superspreading/articles/heterogeneous_network_outbreaks.html).

### Forecasting and nowcasting

Forecasting and nowcasting are crucial for planning and resource allocation during an outbreak. Forecasting is the prediction of future cases, deaths, or other outcomes, while nowcasting is the prediction of the current state of the outbreak.

The [EpiNow2](https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow2/) and [epinowcast](https://package.epinowcast.org/) package provides functions to forecast and nowcast the number of cases. The data required for `{EpiNow2}` have already been described in the previous section. The `{epinowcast}` package similarly requires data on the number of cases reported per date.

### Disease severity (CFR)

The case fatality rate is a key metric to assess the severity of a disease. The case fatality rate is the proportion of deaths among confirmed cases.

With incidence data on the number of cases reported and the number of deaths reported, the [cfr](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/cfr/) package can be used to estimate the case fatality rate and its uncertainty. Importantly, it accounts for the delay between the onset of symptoms and death, which is crucial for accurate estimation of the case fatality rate.

### The impact of interventions

mpox can be mitigated with behaviour change, treatment, and vaccination. Here, a few tools are available to assess the impact of intervention scenarios.

The [epidemics](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epidemics/) package provides ready compartmental models to estimate the impact of vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions like behaviour change, which can conceptually be modelled as a reduction in the transmission rate through changes in the population contact structure.

If we want to explore population-level outbreak dynamics, `{epidemics}` allows for stratifying the population into arbitrary groups, specifying the contact structure between these groups, and rates of interventions. The data required to run these models include: population structure, contact structure, and timing and magnitude of interventions.

## Summary

In this post, we have outlined the tools available to support decision-making in the context of the ongoing outbreak of mpox. These tools are developed by the Epiverse-TRACE team and the wider community and are available as R packages. The tools are designed to be user-friendly and accessible to a wide range of users, from public health professionals to researchers.
