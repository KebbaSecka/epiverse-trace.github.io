There is an ongoing outbreak of mpox globally and countries are on the high alert. Various analyses of the impact of the outbreak at country level are emerging. The US CDC for example has analysed the potential size of outbreaks resulting from transmission within and between households [^1] and the risk of Clade 1 mpox outbreaks among some key populations associated with key transmission routes [^2]. However, the ongoing outbreak will require a coordinated response from the global health community.

The Epiverse-TRACE team is developing a set of tools to help provide analytics support to decision-makers during this outbreak. This post provides an overview of aspects of analytics that could support decision-making in the context of the ongoing outbreak of mpox.

## Common outbreak analytics tasks

Outbreak analytics in the context of the ongoing mpox outbreak involves several tasks that can be handled by existing and emerging R tools. Some of the tasks include estimating the transmission potential, forecasting infection dynamics, estimating severity, and assessing the impact of interventions.

Here, we briefly describe the data required some common tasks, and the ready tools developed by the Epiverse-TRACE team and the wider community.

### Cleaning and validating data

::: {.callout .callout-info}
Data cleaning is often the first task in outbreak analytics. This usually involves identifying and correcting errors in the data, standardizing the format of key variables, and ensuring that the data is in a format that can be used for analysis. Data validation is also important to ensure that the data is accurate.
:::

[`{cleanepi}`](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/cleanepi/)} is useful for cleaning individual-level datasets, and [`{listlist}`](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/linelist/)} can be used to tag and validate key variables in datasets that might change overtime. The [`{numberize}`](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/numberize/) package can also be used to convert numbers written as text. It currently has functionality for English, Spanish, and French.

### Estimating transmission potential

::: {.callout .callout-info}
A key initial question during emerging outbreaks is the transmission potential of the disease. This is typically quantified using parameters such as: the basic reproduction number, $R0$; the time varying reproduction number, $Rt$; and $k$, which captures individual heterogeneity in transmission (i.e. "superspreading" potential). These quantities are useful to assess the potential for further spread of the disease and the impact of interventions.
:::

#### Population level ($R0$ and $Rt$)

The basic reproduction number, $R0$, is the average number of secondary cases produced by a single infected individual in a completely susceptible population. The instantaneous reproduction number, $Rt$, on the other hand, is the average number of secondary cases produced by a single infected individual at time $t$ in a partially susceptible population. The instantaneous reproduction number is a more useful quantity during an outbreak as it accounts for the impact of interventions and changes in population immunity.

If data is available on the daily number of reported cases, [`{EpiNow2}`](https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow2/) and  [`{EpiEstim}`](https://mrc-ide.github.io/EpiEstim/) can be used to estimate the time varying reproduction number, $Rt$. These packages require data on the time scale of transmission (i.e. the generation time, or the serial interval, which is [commonly used as a proxy](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2020.0756) for this). While [`{EpiEstim}`] focuses on retrospective estimation of $Rt$, `{EpiNow2}` is designed for both retrospective and real-time estimation.

In estimating $Rt$, one practical consideration is the impact of various delays (biological and reporting) on the estimates [@charniga2024best;@park2024estimating;@gostic2020practical]. `{EpiNow2}` adjusts for these delays in various ways. For example, it accounts for the symptom onset and reporting delays by taking the incubation period and reporting delay as inputs. Moreover, `{EpiNow2}` can estimate estimate the reporting delay from the data if data on incidence by date of onset and report are available.

Furthermore, dedicated packages have emerged for estimating epidemiological delays from data using best practices. [`{epidist}`](https://epidist.epinowcast.org/articles/epidist.html) offers the ability to estimate delay distributions, accounting for issues such as truncation (i.e., not all disease outcomes will yet be known in real-time).

If delay data are not available, published estimates of the incubation period and serial interval can be used. The [`{epiparameter}`](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epiparameter/) package collates a database of epidemiological distributions from the literature and provides functions for interacting with the database. See the [database here](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epiparameter/dev/articles/database) for currently available parameters (more entries are planned). Additionally, if only summary statistics are available (e.g. range and median), `{epiparameter}` can be used to extract the distribution parameters.

#### Individual level (superspreading)

::: {.callout .callout-info}
The individual-level transmission heterogeneity (superspreading), often denoted as $k$, is an important measure for tailoring interventions at the individual level.
:::

If we have data on the distribution of sizes of transmission clusters, the [`{epichains}`](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epichains/) package provides functions to estimate $R0$ and $k$, by assuming individuals exhibit considerable heterogeneity in transmission. It then models this with the negative binomial distribution.

Furthermore, if we have individual-level transmission chain data, the [`{superspreading}`](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/superspreading/) package can be used to estimate $R0$ and $k$ from the offspring distribution. This package also provides functions to estimate the probability that an outbreak will not go extinct in its early stages because of randomness in transmission (e.g. if the primary spillover case(s) does not infect others).

If we have data on sexual contacts and the secondary attack rate, then we can also use `{superspreading}` to [calculate R0 accounting for network effects](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/superspreading/articles/heterogeneous_network_outbreaks.html).

### Forecasting and nowcasting infection dynamics

::: {.callout .callout-info}
Forecasting and nowcasting of infections are crucial for planning and resource allocation during an outbreak. Forecasting is the prediction of future cases, deaths, or other outcomes, while nowcasting is the prediction of the current outbreak situation. These predictions can help public health authorities to anticipate the trajectory of the outbreak and to implement timely interventions.
:::

[`{EpiNow2}`](https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow2/) and [`{epinowcast}`](https://package.epinowcast.org/) provide functions to forecast and nowcast the number of cases. The data required for `{EpiNow2}` have already been described in the previous section. The `{epinowcast}` package similarly requires data on the number of cases reported per date. `{epinowcast}` does not currently support forecasting but there are plans to add this functionality in future versions.

### Estimating disease severity

::: {.callout .callout-info}
The case fatality ratio (CFR) is often used to assess the severity of a disease. CFR here refers to the proportion of deaths among confirmed cases.
:::

With incidence data on the number of cases reported and the number of deaths reported, the [`{cfr}`](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/cfr/) package can be used to estimate the case fatality rate and its uncertainty. Importantly, it accounts for the delay between the onset of symptoms and death, which is crucial for accurate estimation of the case fatality rate.

Here again, `{EpiNow2}` can be used to estimate the time-varying case fatality ratio using the same data as for the reproduction number. `{EpiNow2}` can estimate other severity metrics, such as the case hospitalisation ratio, given data on cases and hospitalisations, and the hospitalisation fatality ratio, if data on hospitalisations and associated deaths are available.

### Assessing the impact of interventions

::: {.callout .callout-info}
mpox can be mitigated with behaviour change, treatment, and vaccination. Here, a few tools are available to assess the impact of intervention scenarios.
:::

[`{epidemics}`](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epidemics/) provides ready compartmental models to estimate the impact of vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions like behaviour change, which can conceptually be modelled as a reduction in the transmission rate through changes in the population contact structure.

If we want to explore population-level outbreak dynamics, `{epidemics}` allows for stratifying the population into arbitrary groups, specifying the contact structure between these groups, and rates of interventions. The data required to run these models include: population structure, contact structure, and timing and magnitude of interventions.

## Summary

In this post, we have outlined the tools available to support decision-making in the context of the ongoing outbreak of mpox. These tools are developed by the Epiverse-TRACE team and the wider community and are available as R packages. The tools are designed to be user-friendly and accessible to a wide range of users, from public health professionals to researchers.
